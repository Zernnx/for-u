            <p>Hi Hasna, I want to apologize if I’ve ever put pressure on you or made you feel uncomfortable in any way.</p>
            <p>I know I’ve made pressure and mistakes, and there are things I should have done differently. But I want you to know that you still mean so much to me, I’ll wait for you, no matter how long it takes, I’ll always be here for you</p>
            <p>Best wishes,</p>
